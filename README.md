# StatsByTeam

This single-page app was built to visualize basketballreference.com data. Built using Vue.JS, with Python and flask on the backend. my first foray into Vue.JS. Player functionality exists, but team functionality has yet to be built (Primarily due to bballref not taking kindly to me scraping their data)
